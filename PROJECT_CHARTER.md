# Title

Adopt a Knowledge Framework Architecture instead of a Single Manual.

---

# Executive Summary

This Architecture Decision Record (ADR) documents the foundational decision that defines the architecture of the Marketing Research OS (MROS).

Instead of developing a traditional static manual or isolated prompts, the project will be built as a modular, versioned and continuously evolving knowledge framework designed to support AI-assisted scientific research in Marketing.

This decision establishes the principles that will govern every future document, module and contribution.

---

# Context

The initial objective of the project was to create a comprehensive prompt capable of transforming Large Language Models (LLMs) into academic research assistants.

As the project evolved, several limitations became evident.

Traditional manuals suffer from multiple structural problems:

- difficult maintenance;
- duplicated content;
- poor scalability;
- low reusability;
- inability to evolve incrementally;
- limited interoperability with AI systems.

Scientific knowledge also evolves continuously.

New articles, books, theories, AI models and methodologies emerge every year.

A static manual becomes obsolete quickly.

Therefore, a different architectural approach became necessary.

---

# Decision

The project SHALL be developed as a modular Knowledge Framework.

The framework SHALL:

- organize knowledge into independent modules;
- support continuous evolution;
- separate permanent knowledge from project-specific knowledge;
- be version-controlled;
- be AI-friendly;
- be human-readable;
- support future publications;
- support academic research;
- support professional applications.

# Why not a Traditional Manual?

A traditional manual presents several limitations.

| Traditional Manual | Knowledge Framework |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Linear | Modular |
| Difficult to update | Easy to update |
| Static | Dynamic |
| Single document | Distributed documentation |
| Low reuse | High reuse |
| Poor scalability | Excellent scalability |

The framework architecture better reflects how scientific knowledge evolves.

# Architectural Principles

The project adopts the following principles.

## 1. Modularity

Every document shall be independent.

Each module must be understandable without requiring the entire repository.

---

## 2. Scientific Rigor

Every claim must be supported by scientific evidence or explicitly identified as a hypothesis, interpretation or opinion.

---

## 3. Transparency

The framework shall clearly distinguish:

- facts;
- interpretations;
- assumptions;
- recommendations;
- future work.

---

## 4. Reproducibility

Research processes should be reproducible whenever possible.

---

## 5. Human Oversight

Artificial Intelligence supports research.

It never replaces scientific judgment.

---

## 6. Continuous Improvement

Every module can evolve independently.

The repository shall never be considered "finished".

---

# Repository Philosophy

Marketing Research OS is not intended to become a book.

It is intended to become a living knowledge system.

Knowledge should evolve continuously.

Documentation should evolve continuously.

Artificial Intelligence should evolve continuously.

The repository reflects this philosophy.

---

# Repository Layers

The framework is divided into layers.

Layer 1

Foundation

- philosophy
- methodology
- governance

Layer 2

Knowledge

- marketing
- CRM
- customer journey
- AI
- growth
- consumer behavior

Layer 3

Operational Assets

- prompts
- templates
- frameworks
- checklists

Layer 4

Applied Research

- Telex case
- examples
- datasets

# Consequences

Positive consequences

✅ Better organization

✅ Easier maintenance

✅ Better AI integration

✅ Better version control

✅ Better collaboration

✅ Easier publication

Potential drawbacks

⚠ More files

⚠ Higher initial planning effort

⚠ Strong governance required

These drawbacks are acceptable considering the long-term objectives.

# Alternatives Considered

Alternative A

Single Markdown Manual

Rejected.

Reason:

Poor scalability.

---

Alternative B

Single PDF

Rejected.

Reason:

Impossible to maintain efficiently.

---

Alternative C

Collection of Independent Prompts

Rejected.

Reason:

No shared knowledge architecture.

---

Alternative D

Knowledge Framework

Accepted.

Reason:

Best balance between flexibility, maintainability and scientific rigor.

---

# Impact on Future Decisions

Every future architectural decision must comply with this ADR.

If a future proposal conflicts with this document, a new ADR shall be created explaining the rationale.
